CGTools
=======
An ESPResSo-compatible software for implementing simulations of lipid membranes with the systematically coarse-grained solvent-free model for quantitative phospholipid bilayer.

Quick start
-----------
CGTools will *not* run unless a configuration file is specified in argument.
The main script should be parsed inside Espresso : 

   > Espresso cgtoolsmain.tcl <CONFIG_FILE> 
	      [-new]
	      [-replica [-connect HOST]]
	      [-annealing]
	      [-annealfast]

   where the brackets represent optional choices. 

   '-new' starts a new computation by deleting the existing folder if there is
   any, without this choice, the simulation will resume from the last checkpoint.

   '-replica' starts a parallel tempering simulation host. The different
   simulation temperatures are parameterized in the CONFIG_FILE. Adding the
   '-connect HOST' argument is required for slaves to connect to the host.

   '-annealing' starts an annealing simulation.

   '-annealfast' starts a fast annealing process, afterwards equilibrium the system 
   at the end temperature.

   Note that the optional arguments can be alternated, and they do not require
   brackets. 

At the end, the script will have created a new directory with stored configuration 
files inside.

The 'configs/' folder contains several configuration files that are ready to be ran.
